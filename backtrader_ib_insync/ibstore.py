"""IBStore — singleton IB connection and data/order coordination hub.

This module is the backbone of the library.  Everything that touches the IB
API goes through the ``IBStore`` singleton:

* Connection lifecycle — ``ib_insync.IB.connectAsync()`` is wrapped to be
  compatible with Python 3.14's strict asyncio task requirements.
* Historical data — ``reqHistoricalDataEx`` maps a (begindate, enddate) pair
  to one or more IB ``reqHistoricalData`` calls, automatically choosing the
  correct duration/bar-size combination from IB's published limits.
* Live data — ``reqRealTimeBars`` (5-second RTBars) and ``reqMktData``
  (RTVolume ticks or BBO for CASH/CFD instruments).
* Orders — ``placeOrder`` and ``cancelOrder`` proxy to ``ib_insync``.
* Account — ``updateAccountValue`` / ``get_acc_cash`` / ``get_acc_value``
  read account data from ``ib.accountValues()``.

Duration / bar-size lookup tables
----------------------------------
IB imposes strict limits on which bar sizes are valid for a given request
duration.  The class-level ``_durations`` dict encodes these limits as::

    duration_string → tuple of valid bar size strings

``__init__`` inverts this into ``self.revdur``::

    (TimeFrame, compression) → sorted list of valid duration strings

This lets ``reqHistoricalDataEx`` instantly find the longest duration that
fits the requested date range without making multiple IB round-trips.

    parameters the first time the class is instantiated; subsequent calls
    return the cached instance unchanged.

    The parameters can also be specified in the classes which use this store,
    like ``IBData`` and ``IBBroker``

    Params:

      - ``host`` (default:``127.0.0.1``): where IB TWS or IB Gateway are
        actually running. And although this will usually be the localhost, it
        must not be

      - ``port`` (default: ``7496``): port to connect to. The demo system uses
        ``7497``

      - ``clientId`` (default: ``None``): which clientId to use to connect to
        TWS.

        ``None``: generates a random id between 1 and 65535
        An ``integer``: will be passed as the value to use.

      - ``notifyall`` (default: ``False``)

        If ``False`` only ``error`` messages will be sent to the
        ``notify_store`` methods of ``Cerebro`` and ``Strategy``.

        If ``True``, each and every message received from TWS will be notified

      - ``_debug`` (default: ``False``)

        Print all messages received from TWS to standard output

      - ``reconnect`` (default: ``3``)

        Number of attempts to try to reconnect after the 1st connection attempt
        fails

        Set it to a ``-1`` value to keep on reconnecting forever

      - ``timeout`` (default: ``3.0``)

        Time in seconds between reconnection attempts

      - ``timeoffset`` (default: ``True``)

        If True, the time obtained from ``reqCurrentTime`` (IB Server time)
        will be used to calculate the offset to localtime and this offset will
        be used for the price notifications (tickPrice events, for example for
        CASH markets) to modify the locally calculated timestamp.

        The time offset will propagate to other parts of the ``backtrader``
        ecosystem like the **resampling** to align resampling timestamps using
        the calculated offset.

      - ``timerefresh`` (default: ``60.0``)

        Time in seconds: how often the time offset has to be refreshed

      - ``indcash`` (default: ``True``)

        Manage IND codes as if they were cash for price retrieval

      - ``readonly`` (default: ``False``)

        Set to ``True`` when the IB API is configured in read-only mode
        (account data and market data only, no order placement).

      - ``account`` (default: ``''``)
