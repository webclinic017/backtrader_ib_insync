"""IBData — Backtrader data feed for Interactive Brokers.

This module provides a single public class, ``IBData``, which implements
Backtrader's ``DataBase`` interface and delivers OHLCV bars from IB to a
Cerebro strategy.

Data flow overview
------------------
1. ``IBData.__init__`` parses the ``dataname`` string into a preliminary
   ``ib_insync.Contract`` object (``precontract``).
2. ``IBData.start`` asks ``IBStore`` for full contract details (resolves the
   conId), decides whether to use RTBars or RTVolume for live data, and
   kicks off the first data request via ``_st_start``.
3. ``IBData._load`` is the Backtrader hook called once per bar.  It drives a
   simple finite state machine:

   - **_ST_HISTORBACK** — draining a queue of historical bars that were
     pre-fetched by ``_st_start`` (or backfill-on-reconnect).  When the
     queue empties the feed transitions to ``_ST_LIVE``.
   - **_ST_LIVE** — on every ``_load`` call, issues a fresh ``reqMktData``
     (RTVolume ticks) or ``reqRealTimeBars`` (5-second bars) request and
     processes one message from the result queue.
   - **_ST_FROM** — draining an external ``backfill_from`` data source before
     switching to IB historical/live.
   - **_ST_OVER** — terminal state, returns ``False`` to signal end-of-data.

Live data modes
---------------
``rtbar=False`` (default)
    Tick data via ``reqMktData`` tick type 233 (RTVolume for equities) or
    plain BBO ticks for CASH/CFD.  Each tick populates a complete bar with
    open = high = low = close = tick price.

``rtbar=True``
    5-second real-time bars via ``reqRealTimeBars``.  Only available for
    timeframe/compression ≥ Seconds/5.  Uses MIDPOINT pricing.

    Params:

      - ``sectype`` (default: ``STK``)

        Default value to apply as *security type* if not provided in the
        ``dataname`` specification

      - ``exchange`` (default: ``SMART``)

        Default value to apply as *exchange* if not provided in the
        ``dataname`` specification

      - ``currency`` (default: ``''``)

        Default value to apply as *currency* if not provided in the
        ``dataname`` specification

      - ``historical`` (default: ``False``)

        If set to ``True`` the data feed will stop after doing the first
        download of data.

        The standard data feed parameters ``fromdate`` and ``todate`` will be
        used as reference.

        The data feed will make multiple requests if the requested duration is
        larger than the one allowed by IB given the timeframe/compression
        chosen for the data.

      - ``what`` (default: ``None``)

        If ``None`` the default for different assets types will be used for
        historical data requests:

          - 'BID' for CASH assets
          - 'TRADES' for any other

        Use 'ASK' for the Ask quote of cash assets

        Check the IB API docs if another value is wished

      - ``rtbar`` (default: ``False``)

        If ``True`` the ``5 Seconds Realtime bars`` provided by Interactive
        Brokers will be used as the smallest tick. According to the
        documentation they correspond to real-time values (once collated and
        curated by IB)

        If ``False`` then the ``RTVolume`` prices will be used, which are based
        on receiving ticks. In the case of ``CASH`` assets (like for example
        EUR.JPY) ``RTVolume`` will always be used and from it the ``bid`` price
        (industry de-facto standard with IB according to the literature
        scattered over the Internet)

        Even if set to ``True``, if the data is resampled/kept to a
        timeframe/compression below Seconds/5, no real time bars will be used,
        because IB doesn't serve them below that level

      - ``qcheck`` (default: ``0.5``)

        Time in seconds to wake up if no data is received to give a chance to
        resample/replay packets properly and pass notifications up the chain

      - ``backfill_start`` (default: ``True``)

        Perform backfilling at the start. The maximum possible historical data
        will be fetched in a single request.

      - ``backfill`` (default: ``True``)

        Perform backfilling after a disconnection/reconnection cycle. The gap
        duration will be used to download the smallest possible amount of data

      - ``backfill_from`` (default: ``None``)

        An additional data source can be passed to do an initial layer of
        backfilling. Once the data source is depleted and if requested,
        backfilling from IB will take place. This is ideally meant to backfill
        from already stored sources like a file on disk, but not limited to.

      - ``latethrough`` (default: ``False``)

        If the data source is resampled/replayed, some ticks may come in too
        late for the already delivered resampled/replayed bar. If this is
        ``True`` those ticks will be let through in any case.

        Check the Resampler documentation to see how to take those ticks into
        account.

        This can happen especially if ``timeoffset`` is set to ``False`` in
        the ``IBStore`` instance and the TWS server time is not in sync with
        that of the local computer

      - ``tradename`` (default: ``None``)

        Useful for some specific cases like ``CFD`` in which prices are offered
        by one asset and trading happens in a different one:

        - SPY-STK-SMART-USD -> SP500 ETF (will be specified as ``dataname``)
        - SPY-CFD-SMART-USD -> which is the corresponding CFD which offers not
          price tracking but in this case will be the trading asset (specified
          as ``tradename``)

      - ``hist_tzo`` (default: ``0``)

        Timezone offset in hours to apply to historical bar timestamps.
        Backtrader expects UTC; if the IB server returns bars in local time,
        set this to the server's UTC offset (e.g. ``-5`` for US Eastern
        Standard Time) so bars are shifted back to UTC.

    The default values allow a bare ``TICKER`` string, to which ``sectype``
    (default: ``STK``) and ``exchange`` (default: ``SMART``) are applied.

    Some assets like ``AAPL`` need an explicit currency::

        IBData(dataname='AAPL', currency='USD')
        # equivalent to dataname='AAPL-STK-SMART-USD'
    '''
    params = (
        ('sectype', 'STK'),    # security type default
        ('exchange', 'SMART'), # exchange default
        ('currency', ''),      # currency default (empty = IB default)
        ('rtbar', False),      # True = use 5-second RTBars; False = RTVolume ticks
        ('historical', False), # True = download only, then stop
        ('what', None),        # what to show: TRADES, BID, ASK, MIDPOINT, …
        ('useRTH', False),     # True = regular trading hours only
        ('qcheck', 0.5),       # seconds to wait for queue data before yielding
        ('backfill_start', True),   # backfill at startup
        ('backfill', True),         # backfill after reconnection
        ('backfill_from', None),    # alternative data source for initial backfill
        ('latethrough', False),     # allow late ticks through the resampler
        ('tradename', None),        # separate contract for order placement
        ('hist_tzo', 0),            # timezone offset (hours) for historical bars
    )

    _store = IBStore

    # The minimum timeframe/compression supported by IB real-time bars.
    # Anything finer must use RTVolume ticks instead.
    RTBAR_MINSIZE = (TimeFrame.Seconds, 5)

    # States for the finite state machine (FSM) inside ``_load``.
    # The integer values are assigned left-to-right by range(5).
    _ST_FROM        = 0  # consuming an external backfill_from data source
    _ST_START       = 1  # initial state — about to call _st_start()
    _ST_LIVE        = 2  # live data mode (reqMktData or reqRealTimeBars)
    _ST_HISTORBACK  = 3  # draining a historical data queue
