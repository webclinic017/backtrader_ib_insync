"""IBBroker — Backtrader broker implementation for Interactive Brokers.

This module contains three public classes:

``IBOrder``
    A dual-inheritance class that simultaneously satisfies Backtrader's
    ``OrderBase`` interface and ``ib_insync``'s ``order.Order`` structure.
    It translates Backtrader order parameters (exec type, price, TIF, …) into
    the fields that ib_insync expects to send to TWS.

``IBCommInfo``
    A minimal ``CommInfoBase`` subclass used to attach commission information
    to orders so that Backtrader's internal trade accounting keeps working.
    Actual commissions are reported by IB and are not recalculated here.

``IBBroker``
    Implements ``BrokerBase``.  Delegates connection management to the shared
    ``IBStore`` singleton and polls ``ib_insync`` trade objects on every
    Cerebro ``next()`` tick to drive the Backtrader order state machine.

    Inherits from both ``backtrader.OrderBase`` (which carries the strategy
    ref, size, price, exec type, validity, etc.) and from
    ``ib_insync.order.Order`` (which carries the IB-specific fields TWS needs:
    ``orderType``, ``lmtPrice``, ``auxPrice``, ``tif``, etc.).

    ``OrderBase.__init__`` runs first via ``super()`` and populates all
    Backtrader-side attributes.  The body of ``__init__`` then maps those
    attributes onto the corresponding IB fields.

    Extra IB-only parameters (e.g. ``orderType='LIT'``) can be passed as
    **kwargs and are applied directly to the IB order object::

        order = IBOrder('BUY', orderType='LIT', lmtPrice=10.0, auxPrice=9.8)

    This produces a *Limit If Touched* order regardless of the Backtrader
    exec-type mapping — useful for IB order types not natively supported by
    Backtrader.

    Responsibilities
    ----------------
    * Delegates the IB connection to the ``IBStore`` singleton.
    * Translates ``buy()`` / ``sell()`` calls into ``IBOrder`` objects and
      submits them via ``IBStore.placeOrder()``.
    * On every Cerebro ``next()`` cycle, polls ``ib_insync`` trade objects to
      drive order status transitions: Submitted → Accepted → Completed /
      Cancelled / Rejected.
    * Reports cash and portfolio value from the IB account.

    Limitations
    -----------
    * ``tradeid`` is not accurately supported because P&L comes directly from
      IB (FIFO basis) rather than being recalculated locally.
    * Positions opened outside this session (e.g. from another client or a
      manual trade) are not reflected in Backtrader's internal position
      tracking until a ``reqPositions()`` update is received.
